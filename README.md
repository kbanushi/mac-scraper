# mac-scraper

This project is intended to scrape the price of a 16 inch Macbook pro from a few websites online, namely BestBuy, MicroCenter, and Expercom.
It stores the data into a backend, which I chose to host through another heroku website for simplicity, then once it is fetched to the front end the discount of the laptop is calculated and then displayed.

This project uses APIs Axios, Cheerio, Express, Cors, and is hosted on Heroku at https://m16-scraper.herokuapp.com/
NOTE: Since Heroku converted to a paid model the website is no longer being hosted.
